I'm **Kevin Hougasian** &rarr; **@hougasian** most places ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinhougasian?trk=profile-badge), ~[X](https://twitter.com/hougasian)~, [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@hougasian@front-end.social), [GitHub](https://github.com/hougasian), [codepen](https://codepen.io/hougasian)) &mdash; social media less & less these days. 

**Sr. Manager, UI/UX Design** at [**Integrity**](https://integrity.com). Former **Frontend Team Lead** at [**Ritter Insurance Marketing**](https://ritterim.com), and while I use (and encourage!) codepen to work out pieces to share with teammates, [I do get some traction from time to time](https://codepen.io/hougasian/pens/popular) 😜. 

Past lives include Sr. Graphic Designer, hougasian.com (contract agency), Division manager for web and app, Creative Director.
